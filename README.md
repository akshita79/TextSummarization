# Text Summarization using pre-trained model and TOPSIS

Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary. All the models used in the project are pre-trained model. I have used different models for text summarization and Topsis to find the best model.

## Installation



```bash
pip install transformers
```

## Usage

```python
from transformers import pipeline
```

## Dataset
I used the 
cnn-daily mail dataset from the library dataset. Use the following command to install the dataset

```bash
pip install datasets
from datasets import load data
```
